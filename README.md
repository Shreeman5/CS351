CS351/Design of Large Programs/Java

All of the projects listed are done in Java. These projects were done in my fourth
semester at UNM. Mainly, these projects cover concepts of Java like Object-Oriented
programming, Trie Data Structure, Multi-threading and Sockets. 
All of these projects were done from Scratch.
Bouncing Ball, Dominos and Tiles dealt with object oriented programming.
Scrabble also dealt with object oriented programming and the AI opponent used Trie
data structure to store the dictionary given and made the best possible move(most
points) in under 2 seconds.
Project Mobile Agents used multi threading to monitor a forest fire.
Project sockets used multi threading and the Sockets class to deliever information
in a closed network.
